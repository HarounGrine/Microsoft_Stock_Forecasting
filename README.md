# Microsoft Stock Forecasting Using LSTMs

This project implements a deep learning approach to forecast Microsoft stock prices using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks. The goal is to predict stock trends and values by leveraging historical stock market data, focusing on temporal patterns and dependencies that traditional models may not effectively capture.

## Project Overview
Stock market forecasting is a challenging task due to the volatile and non-linear nature of stock prices. This project uses LSTMs, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for its ability to learn from sequential data, to tackle this problem.

The project includes:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, scaling, and reshaping for time-series analysis.
- **Model Development**: Building and training an LSTM model for predictive accuracy.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
- **Visualization**: Plotting actual vs. predicted stock prices to analyze the model's effectiveness.

## Key Features
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Extracted historical stock price data for Microsoft.
   - Scaled features to improve model convergence using MinMaxScaler.
   - Split data into training and testing datasets.

2. **Model Development**:
   - Designed a multi-layer LSTM model in TensorFlow/Keras.
   - Utilized sequential data input with appropriate timesteps.
   - Tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Visualized predictions against actual stock prices.
   - Calculated RMSE and other performance metrics.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Time-series plots for better interpretability.
   - Highlighted trends and deviations between predicted and actual values.
